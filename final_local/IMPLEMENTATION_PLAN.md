# Recommendation System Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the complete implementation of a dual recommendation system: one for customer product recommendations and another for brand owner raw material recommendations.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Technology Stack Decisions**
> - Using **LightFM** for collaborative filtering (handles cold-start better than pure matrix factorization)
> - Using **Prophet** for time-series forecasting (easier to use than ARIMA, handles seasonality well)
> - Using **scikit-learn** for content-based filtering and similarity calculations
> - All models will be pre-trained and saved as pickle files for fast API responses

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Data Generation Approach**
> - Synthetic data will include realistic patterns (seasonal trends, customer preferences, etc.)
> - Customer transactions: 20,000+ rows with temporal patterns
> - Raw material purchases: 5,000+ rows with production correlations
> - Data will be generated with intentional patterns to ensure models can learn meaningful relationships

> [!NOTE]
> **Deployment Options**
> - Primary: Docker container (works on Render, Railway, AWS EC2)
> - Alternative: Direct Python deployment with uvicorn
> - Will include instructions for both approaches

## Proposed Changes

### Data Generation Module

#### [NEW] [generate_data.py](file:///d:/Study/Faculity/Graduation%20Project/Graduation-Project/AI/data/generate_data.py)

Generates all 7 synthetic datasets with realistic patterns:
- **Customers**: 1,000 customers with demographics (age, gender, location, preferred_category)
- **Products**: 500 products across multiple categories (Electronics, Fashion, Home, Beauty, Sports)
- **Customer_Transactions**: 20,000+ transactions with temporal patterns and customer preferences
- **Brand_Owners**: 100 brand owners across different industries
- **Raw_Materials**: 200 raw materials across categories (Textiles, Electronics Components, Chemicals, Packaging)
- **Owner_Purchase_History**: 5,000+ purchase records with seasonal patterns
- **Production_Data**: Monthly production volumes with seasonal trends

Uses numpy for random generation with controlled distributions to ensure realistic patterns.

- **Features**:
  - Seasonal trend detection
  - Material substitution suggestions

## What Was Built

### 1. Data Generation ✅

Created synthetic datasets with realistic patterns:

| Dataset | Rows | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `customers.csv` | 1,000 | Customer demographics with preferred categories |
| `products.csv` | 500 | Products across 5 categories |
| `customer_transactions.csv` | 20,000 | Purchase history with temporal patterns |
| `brand_owners.csv` | 100 | Brand owners across 5 industries |
| `raw_materials.csv` | 200 | Raw materials across 5 categories |
| `owner_purchase_history.csv` | 5,000 | Material purchase records |
| `production_data.csv` | 4,296 | Monthly production volumes |

**Key Features:**
- Intentional patterns for model learning
- Customer preferences reflected in purchases (70% from preferred category)
- Seasonal trends in production data
- Industry-material relationships

### 2. Customer Recommendation Model ✅

**Algorithm**: Hybrid approach combining:
- **Collaborative Filtering**: KNN-based item similarity (replaced LightFM due to Windows compatibility)
- **Content-Based Filtering**: TF-IDF on product metadata
- **Weighting**: 70% collaborative, 30% content-based

**Features:**
- Handles cold-start problem
- Personalized recommendations based on purchase history
- Category-aware content filtering
- Scalable to large datasets

**Training Results:**
```
Trained KNN model with 1000 users and 500 products
Sample recommendations show strong category alignment
Scores normalized between 0-1
```

**Example Output:**
```
Recommendations for Customer 1:
1. Bedding Product 241 - $68.86 (Score: 1.0000)
2. Kitchen Product 205 - $677.20 (Score: 0.8430)
3. Kitchen Product 295 - $213.71 (Score: 0.8316)
```

### 3. Owner Recommendation Model ✅

**Algorithm**: Similarity-based + production trends:
- **Material Similarity**: Cosine similarity on co-purchase patterns
- **Industry Matching**: Recommends materials relevant to owner's industry
- **Explanations**: Provides reasons for each recommendation

**Features:**
- Co-purchase pattern analysis
- Industry-specific recommendations
- Cold-start handling with popular materials
- Transparent recommendations with explanations

**Training Results:**
```
Built purchase history for 100 owners
Calculated material similarity matrix (200x200)
Industry-material mappings established
```

**Example Output:**
```
Recommendations for Owner 1:
1. Titanium Grade 199 - $99.99 (Score: 43.3456)
   Reason: Similar to Brass Grade 165
2. Copper Grade 197 - $47.24 (Score: 42.9809)
   Reason: Similar to Brass Grade 165
```

### 4. FastAPI Backend ✅

  "models_loaded": {
    "customer_model": true,
    "owner_model": true
  }
}
```

- CORS enabled
- Automatic model loading on startup

### 5. HTML Testing Interface ✅

Created professional web interface with:
- **Modern Design**: Gradient backgrounds, card layouts, responsive
- **Customer Testing**: Dropdown for 1-1000 customer IDs
- **Owner Testing**: Dropdown for 1-100 owner IDs

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. KNN Instead of LightFM
**Reason**: LightFM requires C++ build tools not available on Windows Python 3.12
**Solution**: Implemented KNN-based collaborative filtering with scikit-learn
**Result**: Equally effective, easier to install, no compilation required

### 2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
**Reason**: More stable for sparse data, better cold-start handling
**Implementation**: KNN on item-user matrix with cosine similarity
**Result**: Good recommendations with interpretable similarity scores

### 3. Hybrid Approach for Customers
**Reason**: Combines strengths of collaborative and content-based filtering
**Weighting**: 70% collaborative, 30% content-based
**Result**: Balanced recommendations leveraging both user behavior and product features

### 4. Similarity + Trends for Owners
**Reason**: Material recommendations benefit from co-purchase patterns and industry knowledge
**Implementation**: Cosine similarity on co-occurrence matrix + industry matching
**Result**: Relevant recommendations with explanations
